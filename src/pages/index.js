          <li>Download our <a href="/phpDocumentor.phar">PHAR</a> file</li>

            <h3>Getting started using the PHAR</h3>
            <p>
              After you downloaded the PHAR file and giving it a nice and cozy place on your hard drive, don't forget to
              power it up by making it executable.
            </p>
            <code><pre>$ chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar</pre></code>
            <blockquote>
              Also, you may want to consider to rename it to <strong><code>phpdoc</code></strong>; we'll
              understand.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Then, all you need to do is run it!

          <section>
            <h3>Getting started using Docker</h3>
            <p>
              Treat our docker image like you treat all your other utility images. Just don't forgot to volume mount your
              current directory to <code>/data</code> inside the container. Remember: No data, No docs.
            </p>
            <code><pre>docker run --rm -v ${'{PWD}'}:/data phpdoc/phpdoc:3</pre></code>
            <p>
              Tada!

          <h5>But wait? What about composer?</h5>
          <p>
            Ah, you discovered our secret. There is a phpdocumentor composer package that you can use to install
            phpDocumentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            However: phpDocumentor is a complex application, and its libraries are used in countless other
            libraries and applications (2 of our libraries have more than 150 million downloads each); and this means that
            the chances for a conflict between one of our dependencies and yours is high. And when I say high, it is
            really high.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, because of the above: we do not endorse nor actively support installing phpDocumentor using Composer.
